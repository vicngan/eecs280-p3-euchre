The Rules of Euchre (Simplified)


Euchre is a trick-taking card game played with a partial deck. Here is how the "EECS 280" version works:

The Deck: You only use 24 cards: 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace of each suit (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs).

The Players: There are 4 players sitting in a circle.

Team 1: Player 0 and Player 2.

Team 2: Player 1 and Player 3.

The Goal: The first team to reach 10 points wins. Points are scored by winning "tricks" (rounds) in a hand.

The Flow of a Single Hand:

Deal: Each player gets 5 cards. One card is flipped face-up in the middle (the "upcard").

Make Trump (Round 1): Starting from the left of the dealer, players decide if they want the suit of the upcard to become the "Trump" suit (the power suit).

If someone says "Order Up," that suit becomes Trump. The dealer picks up the upcard and discards one card from their hand.

If everyone passes, you go to Round 2.

Make Trump (Round 2): If Round 1 failed, players go around again. This time they can pick any suit to be Trump except the one from the upcard.

Screw the Dealer: If everyone passes again, the dealer must pick a suit.

Play Tricks: Players play 5 rounds (tricks) of 1 card each.

Leading: The first player throws a card.

Following Suit: Everyone else must play the same suit if they have it. If not, they can play any card.

Winning: The highest card wins. Trump cards beat everything else. The winner of the trick leads the next one.

Score:

If the team that chose Trump wins 3 or 4 tricks: 1 point.

If they win all 5 tricks (a "March"): 2 points.

If they fail to win the majority (they get "Euchred"): The other team gets 2 points.

Important Card Values (The Tricky Part): Normally, Ace is high. But in the Trump suit, the Jacks are special:

Right Bower: The Jack of the Trump suit. (Highest card in the game).

Left Bower: The Jack of the other suit with the same color as Trump (e.g., if Hearts is Trump, the Jack of Diamonds is the Left Bower). It counts as a Trump card and is the 2nd highest card.
